# hello-world
My first GitHub repo.  This will contain my first publicly available project, written in C#, which outputs the text "Hello World"

This is my very first readme file, which accompanies my first GitHub branch.

Hi, my name is NickC.  I aspire to increase my development skills and I intend to use C# and Ruby in order to complete my coding assignments.  I'm really liking having my own GitHub repositories to share my progress with the world.
